BUG
- The table delivery order doesn't delete the articles if a delivery order will be deleted.
- Reportbug, the report doesn't show the page footer at each page, repair the summary of a
  bill.

IMPROVING
- Check the BusinessPartnerUI for a better/simple data input user interface.
- More qualified human computer interaction for article, delivery order and bill.
- A bill button in the delivery order user interface, maybe an bill acceleration button.
- Implement a NumberRangeUI or NumberRangeDialog.
- Additional attributes for the business partner or person.
- Comparison between the last build and current version.
